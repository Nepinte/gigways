    <p>Welcome to Gigways LLC (“Gigways,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). Your privacy and the security of your personal information are of paramount importance to us. This Privacy Policy has been carefully crafted to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of how we collect, utilize, safeguard, and store the personal and usage data you provide when you access or interact with our mobile application (“the App”) and any related services.</p>
    <p>Gigways is designed specifically to empower independent contractors and professionals operating within the gig economy—this includes rideshare drivers, delivery couriers, truck operators, and a wide range of other service providers. Our mission is to equip you with reliable and efficient tools that allow you to manage your schedules, meticulously track your earnings and expenses, and engage with a community that fosters connection and mutual support. In addition, we provide advanced safety and wellness features, including driving activity monitoring and the optional Focus Feature, which promotes well-being through collective rest coordination.</p>
    <p>Our Privacy Policy complies with all applicable international, federal, and state data protection laws, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) applicable within the European Union, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and the specific privacy mandates of the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> This category encompasses information that personally identifies you, such as your full name, email address, telephone number, and your state of residence.

All such data collection is strictly opt-in, allowing you full control over whether or not to enable these capabilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Device and Technical Data:</strong> To maintain app security and ensure optimal performance, we collect technical details regarding your device, including device model, operating system version, IP address, and application logs.

  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>3. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Protecting the privacy of minors is a responsibility we take seriously. The Gigways app and services are not designed for use by children under the age of 13 or the minimum age required by local laws. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a minor, we will take immediate steps to delete such information in accordance with legal obligations.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Expanded: User Consent Mechanisms -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>4. User Consent and Control</h2>
    <p>We obtain your explicit and informed consent through clear in-app prompts, settings toggles, and permission requests before collecting any sensitive data such as location and motion information. You can review, modify, or withdraw your consent at any time through the app’s settings or your device’s privacy controls without affecting the lawfulness of prior processing. Our commitment is to provide you with easy-to-understand controls to manage your privacy preferences.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>5. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your trust is essential, and we commit to using your information solely for legitimate and transparent purposes that directly benefit your user experience. Specifically, we employ your data to:</p>

      <li><strong>We do not use your personal data for advertising, marketing, or promotional purposes, nor do we sell or distribute your information to third-party marketers or advertisers.</strong></li>

  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>7. Data Sharing and Security</h2>
    <p>The protection of your personal information is a cornerstone of our privacy commitment. Gigways does not engage in the sale, rental, or leasing of your personal data to third parties. However, to improve service delivery and app performance, we may share aggregated and anonymized data sets with carefully vetted service providers and trusted partners. This shared data is stripped of all personally identifiable information and is used solely for analytical or operational purposes.</p>
    <p>We have implemented robust, industry-leading security measures—including advanced encryption protocols for data both in transit and at rest—to ensure your data is safeguarded against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Access to your personal information is strictly limited to Gigways employees, contractors, and service providers who require it to perform their job functions and who are bound by confidentiality obligations.</p>
    <p>Specifically, we employ SSL/TLS encryption for data transmission, encrypt sensitive data at rest, conduct regular security audits, and apply best practices to maintain data integrity and confidentiality.</p>

We carefully select these partners to maintain the highest standards of privacy and security.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>9. Location and Tracking Compliance</h2>
    <p>Gigways fully complies with the privacy guidelines set forth by <strong>Apple</strong> and <strong>Google</strong> regarding location and motion tracking. All such features are disabled by default and are activated solely upon your explicit, informed consent. These features facilitate the provision of safety alerts, gentle rest reminders, accurate work tracking, and participation in the Focus Feature’s wellness initiatives. You maintain full control over enabling or disabling these features at any time through the app’s settings or your device’s privacy controls.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>10. Driver Density Map Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Driver Density Map feature provides anonymized and aggregated location data exclusively from users who opt to share this information. The sole purpose of this feature is to present real-time insights into driver concentrations, helping users make informed decisions regarding work locations and schedules.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not disclose or share any individual’s precise location or personally identifiable information.</li>
      <li>Participation is completely voluntary, and users may revoke location sharing at any time.</li>
      <li>We maintain stringent security practices to ensure that all shared data is fully protected.</li>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>12. Notifications</h2>
    <p>We may send notifications to keep you informed about important updates related to your work schedule, earnings, breaks, and safety reminders, including driving activity alerts—only after obtaining your explicit consent.

  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>14. Impact of Opting Out of Tracking</h2>
    <p>Disabling location tracking or opting out of certain data collection features may reduce or limit your access to certain app functionalities such as rest reminders, the Driver Density Map, and other wellness tools.

<div class="section">
  <h2>17. PV Rides Privacy, Safety, and Liability Notice</h2>
  <p>PV Rides is an optional feature designed solely to help users coordinate rides with individuals they personally know and trust. The feature functions only between users who have mutually added each other as friends or trusted contacts within the Gigways platform. PV Rides is not available to the general public, does not connect users with strangers, and is not intended for use with unknown or unverified individuals.</p>

  <h3>Private and Mutually Added Contacts</h3>
  <p>PV Rides may be used exclusively between users who have mutually confirmed each other as friends or trusted contacts.

  <h3>Not a Transportation Network Company</h3>
  <p>Gigways is not a Transportation Network Company (TNC), ride-hailing service, taxi service, dispatcher, commercial transportation provider, or mobility platform.

  <h3>Optional Contributions Outside of Gigways</h3>
  <p><strong>Any contribution offered or exchanged between users is entirely optional and takes place outside of Gigways.</strong> Gigways does not support, endorse, manage, process, track, or participate in any contribution or personal arrangement between users under any circumstances.</p>

  <h3>Information Shared for PV Rides</h3>
  <p>Only minimal information is used to facilitate coordination between mutually approved users, such as names and general trip request details. Gigways does not share precise GPS data or personal information with anyone outside the approved friend connection unless required by law or explicitly authorized by the user.</p>

  <h3>Consent for Phone Number Sharing</h3>
  <p>For the purpose of coordinating a PV Ride, both participating users may choose to share their phone numbers with one another. By requesting or accepting a PV Ride, users explicitly agree that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Their phone number may be shared with the mutually approved contact for coordination purposes.</li>
    <li>They may receive calls or messages only related to the privately arranged ride.</li>
    <li>Gigways does not access, monitor, record, or store the content of calls or messages.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>User Responsibility and Assumption of Risk</h3>
  <p>All PV Rides are voluntary, private arrangements between individuals who personally know and trust each other. Users acknowledge and accept full responsibility for their interactions and assume all risks associated with coordinating or participating in a PV Ride. Gigways does not verify the identity, behavior, driving ability, vehicle condition, safety practices, or reliability of any user.</p>

  <h3>No Duty of Oversight or Guarantees</h3>
  <p>Gigways has no duty to supervise, monitor, evaluate, or control any user activity related to PV Rides. Gigways provides the PV Rides feature “as is” without any warranties or guarantees regarding safety, suitability, legality, reliability, or fitness for a particular purpose.</p>

  <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
  <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, <strong>Gigways LLC is not responsible or liable for any injuries, accidents, damages, losses, disputes, misconduct, or incidents</strong> that occur before, during, or after a privately coordinated PV Ride.

  <h3>No Agency or Employment Relationship</h3>
  <p>Using PV Rides does not create any employment, agency, contractor, partnership, joint venture, or representative relationship between users and Gigways. Gigways does not direct or control user actions or decisions.</p>
