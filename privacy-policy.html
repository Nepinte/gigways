    <p>Welcome to GigWays LLC (“GigWays,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). Your privacy and the security of your personal information are of paramount importance to us. This Privacy Policy has been carefully crafted to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of how we collect, utilize, safeguard, and store the personal and usage data you provide when you access or interact with our mobile application (“the App”) and any related services.</p>
    <p>GigWays is designed specifically to empower independent contractors and professionals operating within the gig economy—this includes rideshare drivers, delivery couriers, truck operators, and a wide range of other service providers. Our mission is to equip you with reliable and efficient tools that allow you to manage your schedules, meticulously track your earnings and expenses, and engage with a community that fosters connection and mutual support. In addition, we provide advanced safety and wellness features, including driving activity monitoring and the optional Voice Feature, which promotes well-being through collective rest coordination.</p>
    <p>Our Privacy Policy complies with all applicable international, federal, and state data protection laws, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) applicable within the European Union, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and the specific privacy mandates of the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. By downloading, installing, or otherwise using the GigWays application, you expressly consent to the data collection and usage practices described in this policy. We strongly encourage you to read this document thoroughly to understand how your information is handled and protected by our systems.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>In our commitment to data minimization and privacy, we collect only the information that is necessary to provide, maintain, and improve our services. The categories of data we gather include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> This category encompasses information that personally identifies you, such as your full name, email address, telephone number, and your state of residence. Additionally, we may collect any further profile information that you voluntarily provide in order to personalize your experience and facilitate app functionalities.</li>
      <li><strong>Activity and Usage Data:</strong> We collect detailed information about your work-related activities and app interactions. This includes, but is not limited to, data on your work schedules, hours logged, earnings and expenses tracked, and patterns of app usage. This information is instrumental in delivering seamless services and tailoring features to meet your needs.</li>
      <li><strong>Location and Motion Data (Optional and Consent-Based):</strong> With your explicit and informed consent, we may collect GPS location data and motion-related data to support various advanced features such as rest and break reminders, route optimization, and wellness initiatives tied to the Voice Feature. All such data collection is strictly opt-in, allowing you full control over whether or not to enable these capabilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Device and Technical Data:</strong> To maintain app security and ensure optimal performance, we collect technical details regarding your device, including device model, operating system version, IP address, and application logs. This data assists us in identifying and resolving technical issues, as well as optimizing the app for diverse device configurations.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>3. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Protecting the privacy of minors is a responsibility we take seriously. The GigWays app and services are not designed for use by children under the age of 13 or the minimum age required by local laws. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a minor, we will take immediate steps to delete such information in accordance with legal obligations.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Expanded: User Consent Mechanisms -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>4. User Consent and Control</h2>
    <p>We obtain your explicit and informed consent through clear in-app prompts, settings toggles, and permission requests before collecting any sensitive data such as location and motion information. You can review, modify, or withdraw your consent at any time through the app’s settings or your device’s privacy controls without affecting the lawfulness of prior processing. Our commitment is to provide you with easy-to-understand controls to manage your privacy preferences.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>5. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your trust is essential, and we commit to using your information solely for legitimate and transparent purposes that directly benefit your user experience. Specifically, we employ your data to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Facilitate and optimize the core functionalities of the GigWays app, including scheduling management, mileage tracking, logging expenses, and summarizing earnings, thereby empowering you to efficiently organize and monitor your gig economy work.</li>

Participation in this feature is strictly voluntary, and individual data is never shared with third parties.</li>
      <li><strong>We do not use your personal data for advertising, marketing, or promotional purposes, nor do we sell or distribute your information to third-party marketers or advertisers.</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- New: Automated Decision-Making -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>6. Automated Decision-Making and Profiling</h2>

  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>7. Data Sharing and Security</h2>
    <p>The protection of your personal information is a cornerstone of our privacy commitment. GigWays does not engage in the sale, rental, or leasing of your personal data to third parties. However, to improve service delivery and app performance, we may share aggregated and anonymized data sets with carefully vetted service providers and trusted partners. This shared data is stripped of all personally identifiable information and is used solely for analytical or operational purposes.</p>
    <p>We have implemented robust, industry-leading security measures—including advanced encryption protocols for data both in transit and at rest—to ensure your data is safeguarded against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Access to your personal information is strictly limited to GigWays employees, contractors, and service providers who require it to perform their job functions and who are bound by confidentiality obligations.</p>
    <p>Specifically, we employ SSL/TLS encryption for data transmission, encrypt sensitive data at rest, conduct regular security audits, and apply best practices to maintain data integrity and confidentiality.</p>

We carefully select these partners to maintain the highest standards of privacy and security.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>9. Location and Tracking Compliance</h2>
    <p>GigWays fully complies with the privacy guidelines set forth by <strong>Apple</strong> and <strong>Google</strong> regarding location and motion tracking.

You maintain full control over enabling or disabling these features at any time through the app’s settings or your device’s privacy controls.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>10. Driver Density Map Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Driver Density Map feature provides anonymized and aggregated location data exclusively from users who opt to share this information.

    <ul>
      <li>We do not disclose or share any individual’s precise location or personally identifiable information.</li>
      <li>Participation is completely voluntary, and users may revoke location sharing at any time.</li>
      <li>We maintain stringent security practices to ensure that all shared data is fully protected.</li>
