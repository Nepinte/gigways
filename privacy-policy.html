          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to Gigways LLC (“Gigways,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). Your privacy and the security of your personal
            information are of paramount importance to us. This Privacy Policy has been carefully crafted to provide you
            with a comprehensive understanding of how we collect, utilize, safeguard, and store the personal and usage
            data you provide when you access or interact with our mobile application (“the App”) and any related
            services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gigways is designed specifically to empower independent contractors and professionals operating within the
            gig economy—this includes rideshare drivers, delivery couriers, truck operators, and a wide range of other
            service providers. Our mission is to equip you with reliable and efficient tools that allow you to manage
            your schedules, meticulously track your earnings and expenses, and engage with a community that fosters
            connection and mutual support. In addition, we provide advanced safety and wellness features, including
            driving activity monitoring and the optional Focus Feature, which promotes well-being through collective
            rest coordination.
          </p>

          <p>
            This Privacy Policy is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Users

          <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>
            In our commitment to data minimization and privacy, we collect only the information that is necessary to
            provide, maintain, and improve our services. The categories of data we gather include, but are not limited
            to, the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Personal Information:</strong> This category encompasses information that personally identifies
              you, such as your full name, email address, telephone number, and your state of residence. Additionally,
              we may collect any further profile information that you voluntarily provide in order to personalize your
              experience and facilitate app functionalities.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Activity and Usage Data:</strong> We collect detailed information about your work-related
              activities and app interactions. This includes, but is not limited to, data on your work schedules, hours
              logged, earnings and expenses tracked, and patterns of app usage. This information is instrumental in
              delivering seamless services and tailoring features to meet your needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Location and Motion Data (Optional and Consent-Based):</strong> With your explicit and informed
              consent, we may collect GPS location data and motion-related data to support various advanced features
              such as rest and break reminders, route optimization, and wellness initiatives tied to the Focus Feature.
              All such data collection is strictly opt-in, allowing you full control over whether or not to enable these
              capabilities.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Device and Technical Data:</strong> To maintain app security and ensure optimal performance, we
              collect technical details regarding your device, including device model, operating system version, IP
              address, and application logs. This data assists us in identifying and resolving technical issues, as well
              as optimizing the app for diverse device configurations.

              <strong>Car Ads / Vehicle Advertising Data (Optional):</strong> If you choose to participate in any Car Ads / vehicle
              advertising program offered that involves drivers displaying advertisements on vehicles and advertisers running campaigns,
              we may collect additional information depending on your role:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Drivers:</strong> vehicle details (such as make, model, year, color, and license plate number), verification media
                  (photos or videos of the vehicle and ad placement), campaign participation status, and payout-related details. With your explicit
                  consent, we may collect location and/or mileage data during active campaign participation for verification and reporting.

                <li>
                  <strong>Advertisers:</strong> business and contact information, billing details, ad creative materials, targeting preferences,

          <h2>3. Children’s Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            Protecting the privacy of minors is a responsibility we take seriously. The Gigways app and services are not
            designed for use by children under the age of 13 or the minimum age required by local laws. We do not
            knowingly solicit or collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have
            inadvertently collected personal data from a minor, we will take immediate steps to delete such information
            in accordance with legal obligations.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>4. User Consent and Control</h2>
          <p>
            We obtain your explicit and informed consent through clear in-app prompts, settings toggles, and permission
            requests before collecting any sensitive data such as location and motion information. You can review,
            modify, or withdraw your consent at any time through the app’s settings or your device’s privacy controls
            without affecting the lawfulness of prior processing. Our commitment is to provide you with easy-to-understand
            controls to manage your privacy preferences.
          </p>
          <!-- Improvement -->
          <p>
            Withdrawing consent may limit or disable certain features but will not result in penalties or account
            termination.
          </p>

          <!-- NEW: Car Ads consent -->
          <p>
            If you participate in Car Ads / vehicle advertising features, any collection of verification media (such as photos) and any optional
            location, motion, or mileage tracking used for campaign verification and reporting will be subject to your explicit consent and can be
            managed through the app’s settings or your device permissions. Withdrawing consent may limit participation in Car Ads campaigns but will
            not otherwise restrict your access to non-Car Ads features.

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>5. How We Use Your Information</h2>

            </li>
            <li>
              Create, maintain, and provide accurate work-related documentation such as detailed time logs and mileage

            <li>
              Analyze anonymized, aggregated usage data to continually enhance the app’s functionality, interface design,

            </li>
            <li>
              Operate the optional Focus Feature, enabling users to voluntarily schedule rest days and wellness breaks.
              Data generated from participation supports calculation of driver density forecasts, providing valuable
              insights into driver activity and concentration by geographic location. Participation in this feature is
              strictly voluntary, and individual data is never shared with third parties.

          <h2>6. Automated Decision-Making and Profiling</h2>
          <p>
            Gigways does not use any form of automated decision-making or profiling that would have a legal or
            significant effect on you. All decisions regarding your account and services are reviewed or implemented
            with appropriate human oversight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Car Ads / vehicle advertising campaign matching, if offered, may involve software-assisted recommendations based on non-sensitive factors
            (such as general geography, vehicle eligibility criteria, and campaign availability). Participation is optional and does not produce legal or
            similarly significant effects on users.

        <div class="section">
          <h2>7. Data Sharing and Security</h2>
          <p>
            The protection of your personal information is a cornerstone of our privacy commitment. Gigways does not
            engage in the sale, rental, or leasing of your personal data to third parties. However, to improve service
            delivery and app performance, we may share aggregated and anonymized data sets with carefully vetted service
            providers and trusted partners. This shared data is stripped of all personally identifiable information and
            is used solely for analytical or operational purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have implemented robust, industry-leading security measures—including advanced encryption protocols for
            data both in transit and at rest—to ensure your data is safeguarded against unauthorized access, disclosure,
            alteration, or destruction. Access to your personal information is strictly limited to Gigways employees,
            contractors, and service providers who require it to perform their job functions and who are bound by
            confidentiality obligations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Specifically, we employ SSL/TLS encryption for data transmission, encrypt sensitive data at rest, conduct
            regular security audits, and apply best practices to maintain data integrity and confidentiality.
          </p>
          <!-- Improvement -->
          <p>
            Gigways is not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party services linked from or integrated with
            the app. Users should review third-party privacy policies independently.
          </p>

          <!-- NEW: Car Ads sharing -->
          <p>
            If you participate in Car Ads / vehicle advertising, we may share limited information as needed to operate campaigns, such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Reporting to Advertisers:</strong> We may provide advertisers with campaign reports that may include aggregated or anonymized
              performance data (for example, generalized geographic reach, estimated impressions, and campaign duration). We do not share drivers’
              personal contact details with advertisers unless explicitly required for campaign operations and permitted by the driver.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Verification and Compliance:</strong> Verification media (such as photos of ad placement) may be reviewed by Gigways and/or
              service providers acting on our behalf solely to validate compliance and reporting.
            </li>

            <strong>friends rides, food pickup, and parcel drop</strong> with individuals they personally
            know and trust. The feature functions only between users who have mutually added each other
            as friends or trusted contacts within the Gigways platform.
            Private Trips is not available to the general public, does not connect users with strangers,
            and is not intended for use with unknown or unverified individuals.
          </p>

          <!-- Improvement -->
          <p>
            Private Trips is a coordination feature only and does not involve Gigways in execution, fulfillment, or supervision of any activity.

          <h3>Private and Mutually Added Contacts</h3>
          <p>
            Private Trips may be used exclusively between users who have mutually confirmed each other
            as friends or trusted contacts. Both users must establish this connection before any
            Private Trip request can be sent or accepted.

            arranging, or directing any ride, food pickup, or parcel drop activity.
          </p>

          <h3>Not a Transportation, Delivery, or Logistics Provider</h3>

            material, or personal arrangement between users under any circumstances.
          </p>

          <h3>Information Shared for Private Trips</h3>
          <p>
            Only minimal information is used to facilitate coordination between mutually approved users,
            such as names and general request details related to a ride, food pickup, or parcel drop.
            Gigways does not share precise GPS location data or personal information with anyone outside
            the approved friend connection unless required by law or explicitly authorized by the user.
          </p>

          <h3>Consent for Phone Number Sharing</h3>
          <p>

          <p>
            Food pickup requests are private, non-commercial arrangements between users who personally know and trust each other.
            Food pickup involves a <strong>mobile or direct order placed by the user with a third-party store or restaurant</strong>,
            which is then picked up and brought by a mutually approved trusted contact.

            All Private Trips are voluntary, private arrangements between individuals who personally know and trust each other.
            Users acknowledge and accept full responsibility for their interactions and assume all risks associated with coordinating
            or participating in a Private Trip, including rides, food pickup, and parcel drop activities.
            Gigways does not verify the identity, behavior, driving ability, vehicle condition, safety practices, parcel contents,
            or food handling practices of any user.
